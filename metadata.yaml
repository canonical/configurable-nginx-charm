  An Nginx charm that can take a nginx.conf.

  This is not a replacement for `nginx-ingress-integrator`. Instead this charm just runs an nginx container and allows you to push a nginx.conf file to it.

  An example usage for this charm is to setup a proxy that points forwards requests from one url to another. Although to receive the requests from the first url you will need to setup some kind of ingress.

containers:
  nginx:
    resource: nginx-image

resources:
  nginx-image:
    type: oci-image
